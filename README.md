# Personal Site in Bootstrap
The goal of this project is to re-create my [personal site](https://jackwaterloo.com/) using boostrap.

This project displays my use of HTML, CSS, and the Bootstrap framework.
You can view the deployed version of this project at the following link: [https://jackwaterloo.github.io/personal-site-bootstrap/](https://jackwaterloo.github.io/personal-site-bootstrap/).

I may also create a repository re-creating the website just using bare HTML and CSS without Bootstrap. I will link that below when/if I make that.
